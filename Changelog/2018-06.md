June is over, and has been a crazy month for us, as we have finally released the new Backlog to the public.
We call it our "Early Access" release month, because even if the new Backlog is out and ready to use by everyone,
there is still a lot of work to do. "Early Access" stands for changes, and we have plans for a lot of changes.

We plan to make changes and implement fixes constantly, and we want to make a monthly recap to inform
about what have been done and what is coming to the Backlog.

According to our geeky tools, this month had 42 commits in all branches.
On master, 220 files have changed and there have been 18,918 additions and 3,682 deletions.
This means a lot of work, big things and little tweaks. We have been mainly focused on ensuring that
every user can access his Backlog, or at least, know why it's games are not showing up.

June 2018 - Early access release
* NEW: Users now can create new collections, add games to their collections and set a poster.
* ADDED: Messages to inform users why their library is not syncing.
(Hint: It's always private profiles)
* ADDED: Game card modal now displays current players and all-time peak players.
* FIX: Games now can be hidden and unhidden from the Backlog.
* FIX: Fixed a lot of bugs thanks to user feedback.

What is our roadmap for July?
July is summer time, but we can't stop, won't stop.
This month we want to make collections awesome. Edit existing collections, sorting the games, and sharing a beautiful page are our priorities.
