June is over, summer is here and oh my god is hot.
Be sure to drink a lot of water and stay hydrated homies.

This month I have been working on new home sections, the "next steam sale" page, new tags in filters and a few usability and ui improvements.

We have also partnered with [url=https://steamcustomizer.com]Steam Customizer[/url]. Be sure to check them out!
