Happy year of the pig!

This month we have been working on improving the browser by allowing anyone to browse steam games without logging in, we have added a few messages and fixes here and there to improve the user experience and we have implemented a new feature to export a list as Excel.

Exporting a list of games is a point of our 2019 roadmap.

[h1]ðŸ”® What is our roadmap for March?[/h1]
In March we are going to make a big step, and rewrite almost all the frontend code to adapt the site to Bootstrap. This will allow us
to make the iste responsive so people can use the site on mobile devices. As this is going to be very time consuming, we won't make any other changes to the site this month until we have everything running again.
