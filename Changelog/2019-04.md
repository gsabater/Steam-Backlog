In April, my main objective has been to bring a new dedicated page for each game.
Now, every game on steam has a Steam Backlog page, with all the known information like
scores, screenshots, features, release date, links to purchase, etc...

This page can be shared and users can also see their backlog status in the same page, as well as add the game to any list.

The game page is the fourth point of [url=https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steam-backlog#announcements/detail/1720838519398595279]my 2019 roadmap[/url].

We have also been verified as a [url=https://brave.com/ste957]Brave content creator[/url].
