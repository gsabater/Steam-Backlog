Another month has passed, and in July we have been working hard on adding a new critical feature for the site, Collections. Now, users can create as many collections as they want with the new collection editor interface. Those collections can be public or private, and can be shared with anyone using the collection own URL. Every user has a page with their creations in their profile. You can see yours via the top menu dropdown.

A new page has been added to the main menu https://steam-backlog.com/collections displaying the most popular, most recent and some random collections.

In addition to that, we have solved bugs, monitored issues and polished rought edges here and there.
