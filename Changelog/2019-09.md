[h1]ðŸ”® What is the roadmap for October?[/h1]
My main goal with the site is to create new tools for users, improve the user profile and dashboard, and improve the search functionality as well.
My secondary goal is to create a journal where users can take notes about the games and mark specific dates.
I'm also thinking about releasing a PRO plan for supporting the site.
