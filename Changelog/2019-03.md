March is over, April is here, and with it, the spring has arrived.

This month has been a complete blast. We have changed the interface in all the website. The beta browser we released a few months ago, is now the default browsing experience, and we expect to be a much better filtering experience.

We have also established the basics to transform the site for mobile devices and we expect to improve the site on the following months.

The new redesign is a point of our 2019 roadmap.
