August has been a hot month, that's why we have been working on the site at night, but even with the heat, we have succulent changes.

The highlights for this month are: a new backlog layout, where filters and libraries are divided and easier to operte with; a new gallery in the game card with Steam screenshots; and a new page to contact us.
