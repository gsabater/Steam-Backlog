A new month is over, November, and this month we have been working in improving the way our pages work, giving more love to user areas.

The highlights for this month are:

* Your backlog is now public, and you have a single URL for each of your backlog categories, for example:

My Playing ( https://steam-backlog.com/u/gohrum/playing ) and
My Completed ( https://steam-backlog.com/u/gohrum/completed ) games.

This new pages are in the user profile, which has also been upgraded, and now, the profile, the collections and all user backlog categories have the same style.

* Added more DLC to the pool of apps

* Multiple bug fixes

[h1]ðŸ”® What is our roadmap for December?[/h1]

We don't have big plans for December, Christmas is around the corner and we won't be around the whole month. We have big things for next year though, so December is going to be a polishing and bug fixing month. Our main focus this month is to tweak the backlog search interface.
