August is over, the summer is ending, and the world starts working again.
I have been travelling with my girfriend, and this summer we've been in Germany and Italy!

The headline for this month is: A new menu to quickly categorize games. More status available and a few bugfixes.

[h1]â˜• Detailed changelog [/h1]

[b]NEW: [/b] New feature: Quick backlog management
- Users can add any game to their backlog with just two clicks.
- Also it's possible to quickly add games to custom collections (lists).

[b]NEW: [/b] Two new status have been added: Backlog and Favorites
- Favorites is the place to put your most beloved games
- Backlog is a new status where you can put any games you haven't played yet
- This leaves the category "Paused" for games already played but unfinished

[b]UPDATED: [/b] Now it's possible to remove the status of a game

[b]FIXED: [/b] Fixed a bug when filtering games with achievements
- Closes [url=https://github.com/gsabater/Steam-Backlog/issues/87]#87[/url], Thanks MakoSipper!

[b]FIXED: [/b] Fixed a bug with NSFW, Beat'em up and Shoot'em up game categories
- The bug prevented the filters to show a healthy amount of games


[h1]ðŸ”® What is the roadmap for September?[/h1]
I would like to finish a few features related to share preset search filters as well as adding a few more filters and sorting options.
Then, i would like to add a global site-wide search bar.
And finally, i'm going to start thinking on a new feature related to a gaming journal.
